Introduction
============

In this book we will see how our code interacts with the glibc library which
inturn interacts with the system calls in order to get some work done from the
computer.

We will go deep into the glibc code and see how it is all organized. How system
calls are called from the user space programs.  How arguments are passed and
how are return values accessed.

We will see the code, we will see the same thing using debugger. The same thing
we will see with the strace utility as well.
